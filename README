Thanx for trying out my cute little playlistwidget.
It is a part of kyamo, my music-organiser. I found that this widget is good enough, to stand on its own.
Maybe other projects want to use it.

You can use and modify it at your own likes.
In the html-folder is the api-documentation of the widget, generated with doxygen.
In the main.cpp is only a tiny example-code, to show how to get things going.
Use qmake and than make to compile the example.

Really important is that you include the taglib-part into your pro-file, as it is included it mine,
otherwise taglib-support will not be found.

If you only want to use the taglib-part, you can do this also. It does already a good job in k-yamo.

I would be pleased to hear from any implementations.

Regards,

Roland Weigert
