0.3 Cleaned out the code, so most of the k-yamo-specific-stuff is not in there anymore.
    Sorted out the sourcecode into folders and added all pictures this time.
    Improved the order in the constructors, so there are no more warnings on compile.
    Added a Delegate to get artist and album on a seperate line.
    Completed the api-documentation.

0.2  Only made a better example-app, that wires a bit more.
     Also the icon is set this time, so albums without cover in tags get shown right.
